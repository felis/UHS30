Generic partition and filesystem hooks for Arduino

<pre>
* IMPORTANT! PLEASE USE Arduino 1.0.5 or better!
* Older versions HAVE MAJOR BUGS AND WILL NOT WORK AT ALL!
* Use of gcc-avr and lib-c that is newer than the Arduino version is even better.

Currently supports FAT 16/32, and long filenames.

Built-in support for USB shield from <A HREF="https://www.circuitsathome.com/category/mcu/arduino/usb-shield/">Circuits at Home</A>

NOTE: The USB host driver SHOULD BE 100% compatible with all devices supporting BULK STORAGE.
      USB thumb drives, card readers, ATA bridges, and SATA bridges are all known to work.
